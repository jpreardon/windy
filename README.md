# Windy (working title)

This is meant to be a sculpture (of sorts) that will artfully display wind speed and direction from a given place on the earth. I started with the by playing around with the motor controls on an Arduino Uno. That's all that's here so far, just a stepper for wind direction and a DC motor for speed. To be clear, It's not using any weather data at this point. Much, much more work to do here. The most challenging for me will be the mechanics of it.

Here's a [brief demo(https://youtu.be/bPWViPjHqGI)] of it going through some random wind directions and speeds.
